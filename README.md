## Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to develop and evaluate a machine learning model for a classification task. The goal is to accurately predict the target variable using various features from the dataset.

## Key Activities
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loading the dataset.
   - Cleaning the data and handling missing values.
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Development**:
   - Training a `DecisionTreeClassifier` using the training dataset.
   - Implementing feature selection or extraction methods.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluating the model's performance using the test dataset.
   - Calculating accuracy and other relevant metrics to assess the model's effectiveness.

## Technology Used
1. **Programming Language**:
   - Python

2. **Libraries and Frameworks**:
   - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
   - Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.

3. **Tools**:
   - Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and visualization.
